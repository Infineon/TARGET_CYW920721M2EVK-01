# CYW920721M2EVK-01

### Overview

The Infineon CYW920721M2EVK-01 Evaluation kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth&#174; applications using the CYW20721, an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth&#174; 5.1 wireless MCU device for Audio. The CYW20721 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth&#174; LE/BR/EDR. The CYW20721 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the device's footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market.

* 40-QFN CYW20721B2 dual-mode (LE/BR/EDR) Bluetooth&#174; 5.1-compliant wireless MCU with external 8TR8211C Low Noise Amplifier and Power Amplifier (eLNA/ePA)
* Audio Arduino shield with on-board analog microphones, audio codec chip, headphone and speaker output
* On-board sensors - an ambient light sensor, thermistor, and footprint for an Infineon digital microphone
* User switches and LEDs
* USB connector for power, programming, and USB-UART bridge

### Kit Contents

* CYW9BTM2BASE1 base board
* CYW920721M2EPA2 Bluetooth&#174; radio card (mounted on the base board)
* CYW9BT Audio 3 Arduino shield (pre-assembled on top of the CYW9BTM2BASE1)
* USB Standard-A to Micro-B cable
* Power Adapter

### Additional Information

Max UART baud rate is 3M.
Many GPIO are dedicated to audio shield interface support. Use the device configurator to modify pin assignments in order to use test programs such as hello_client and hal/gpio. Refer to the kit schematics to make pin assignment decisions.
